"""DINOv3 Model Module.

``DinoV3PlModel`` inherits the entire ``nvdinov2`` Lightning flow (training step, teacher
EMA and optimizer/scheduler config), with DINOv3-owned checkpoint callbacks and
data loading. It builds the DINOv3 RoPE ViT (no absolute pos-embed, per-type FFN)
using the patch-16 v3 param map; NVDINOv2 behavior is unchanged.

The checkpoint remapper (Meta/timm DINOv3 -> this ViT) and the Gram-anchoring loss
(``_extra_losses``) land in later steps; this file is the build + inheritance scaffold so
the family imports, ``dinov3 --help`` resolves, and the ViT-B builds.

        Two terms, both measured against the **same single forward** of the frozen anchor
        teacher (its output dict carries ``x_norm_clstoken`` alongside ``x_norm_patchtokens``,
        so CLS preservation costs no extra teacher pass):

        * **Gram anchoring** -- MSE between student and anchor patch-cosine Gram matrices,
          preserving the dense/patch geometry. Gated on ``gram.enable`` and ``gram.start_step``.
        * **CLS preservation** -- MSE + cosine distance between student and anchor CLS tokens,
          preserving the global embedding geometry that k-NN/linear-probe/retrieval consume.
          Gated on ``preservation.enable``.

        **Input contract (important when reading these values).** The student tensors come from
        the *masked* global crops the SSL step already computed, while the anchor runs on the
        *unmasked* crops -- matching how DINOv3 applies Gram anchoring, and avoiding a second
        student forward. Both terms are therefore a sum of two things: preservation of the
        pretrained geometry (the intent) **and** sensitivity to iBOT masking. They are
        consequently **not zero at step 0** even when the weights are identical, and they must
        not be read as pure drift metrics.

        Measured on ViT-B at init, where student and anchor weights are identical by
        construction (LoRA is an identity at ``lora_B = 0``):

        =====================  =========  =========  =========
        condition              gram       cls_mse    cls_cos
        =====================  =========  =========  =========
        unmasked, eval          3.7e-09    4.3e-08    1.2e-07
        30% masked, train       2.4e-02    5.8e-01    9.3e-01
        =====================  =========  =========  =========

        So the identity property is exact, but only observable with masking and stochastic
        depth disabled -- which is how a sync/remap regression should be checked. During
        training the value is dominated by masking and drop_path noise. For a true drift
        measurement, run the anchor comparison periodically in eval mode on unmasked crops.

        Both terms are logged unconditionally when active (even at weight 0). Returns an empty
        list -- matching the DINOv2 base, hence unchanged numerics -- when neither is active.

        Args:
            **ctx: Context forwarded from ``DinoV2PlModel.student_forward`` (global/local

        The inherited NVDINOv2 implementation wires the periodic checkpoint with

        ``checkpoint_interval_unit``, unlike the core base class, which supports both. That is
        harmless for NVDINOv2's own recipes, but it makes step-unit checkpointing silently
        no-op: a spec asking for "every 1000 steps" becomes "every 1000 *epochs*", i.e. never.

        On a time-capped scheduler that is not a cosmetic difference. Whenever a single epoch
        takes longer than the per-job wall-clock limit -- routine for SSL pretraining on a large
        corpus -- an epoch boundary is never reached inside one allocation. With epoch-only
        checkpointing a requeued run then restarts from step 0 every time and never finishes,
        and because the periodic callback is also what writes the full Lightning checkpoint that
        resume consumes, there is nothing to resume *from* either. Step-unit checkpointing is
        what makes a requeue/resume loop viable at all.

        DINOv3-owned callbacks use public constructors and do not mutate shared
        NVDINOv2 or TAO exception callback class attributes. Best-metric handling
